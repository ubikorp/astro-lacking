title: 'The Paranoyds :: Pet Cemetery'
subtitle: " &bull; released 2020-11-27"
category: details
publishDate: '2020-11-27'
slug: pet-cemetery-paranoyds
excerpt: Spooky and unhinged, this single plods along with the menacing tone you might
  expect from the title. The flip side is more interesting, with call-and-response
  vocals, a bad attitude, and a woozy organ.
