publishDate: '2024-10-22'
slug: surviving-dream-fidlar
excerpt: Another band with a well-earned penchant for ALL-CAPS, overbrimming with
  adolescent incorrigible behavior sung about from the perspective of adults proving
  it is indeed corrigible. The music is hyper-pop-punk and the irony levels are high.
