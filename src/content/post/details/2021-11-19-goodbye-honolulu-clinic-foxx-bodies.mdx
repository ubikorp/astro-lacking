<Introduction>
I mentioned the end-of-the-year music release floodgates opening up in the last newsletter, and I have been busy keeping my head above the water, listening to all these great sounds instead of putting this newsletter together. The flow is unstoppable!

As always, you can let me know your thoughts and suggestions by replying to this newsletter.

If you received this as a forward, you can [subscribe now](https://the.lacking.org/newsletter) to get your own future copies. On with the show!
