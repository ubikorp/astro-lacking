title: 'black midi :: Covercade'
subtitle: Rough Trade &bull; released 2021-05-28
category: details
publishDate: '2021-09-10'
slug: covercade-black-midi
excerpt: Out of many odd cover-filled releases bands have ejected over the last year-plus,
  this is one of the most disparate and interesting, partly from the selections and
  the interstitial music, but mostly because itâ€™s not what you expect from black midi.
