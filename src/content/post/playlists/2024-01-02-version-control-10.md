excerpt: Tonight’s show kicks off with a long overdue hour of **Version Control 10**
  — our special blend of songs that you might call “covers”. About a year ago, I filled
  three hours with covers, which leads me to believe something is messing with the
  covers ecosystem, and I have my theories. The middle hour was a regular Mixtape
  (if such a thing can be allowed), and the Final Hour was its usual rocketride mindtrip,
  a big thank you to all that came aboard.
