excerpt: 'I’ve been noticing a dry spell on covers making it onto the show, but that
  was busted tonight with an inordinate (and quite varied) set of songs, starting
  with **Robyn Hitchcock**’s take on the Small Faces’ “Itchycoo Park.” He’s got an
  album of mostly covers, specifically from the year 1967, on the way, and this single
  is blazing the way. Also covered tonight: David Bowie, Dire Straits, Duke Ellington,
  Daniel Johnston, and the Bar-Kays.'
