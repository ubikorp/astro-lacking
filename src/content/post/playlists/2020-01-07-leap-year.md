excerpt: The cryptographer tried to once again estimate the circumference of the lighthouse,
  asking the question aloud and then naming best guesses. The compulsion to know these
  geometric factors was strong. The agronomist successfully prevented their eyes from
  rolling. The history of this place was more interesting, having provided a high
  point from which to shine a light for centuries, currently for Estonia but briefly
  for the Kingdom of Torgu. That last bit of trivia was relevant because they were
  here to meet with the self-appointed Official Court Jester, who had requested they
  journey to this location on a rented tandem bicycle. They had also requested ice
  cream, “any color except white.” It waited in a cooler strapped to the bicycle’s
  ample frame.
