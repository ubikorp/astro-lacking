  served tiny delicate cups of the most aromatic and poisonous espresso. All of these
  events were framed as interrupted cribbage games. Maybe they played too much. The
  phlebotomist ruminated on this as they locked up their two-wheel drive all-terrain
  motorbikes across the street from Kirov Park. The Transnistrian passports had been
  excruciatingly expensive, but the ergonomist insisted it was justified, for complicated
  political reasons. The pieces rattled against the cribbage board and the very dangerous
  little notebook in the messenger bag as they strolled through the trail, looking
  for a man holding two empty water bottles.
