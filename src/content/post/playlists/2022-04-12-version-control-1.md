title: Version Control 1.0
subtitle: KAFM Grand Junction, 9pm - 12am
category: playlists
publishDate: '2022-04-12'
slug: 2022-04-12-version-control-1
excerpt: I’ve done a couple dozen all-covers shows already, usually during fundraising,
  but for some reason have never come up with a name for them. It must have been because
  the painfully obvious **Version Control** hadn’t occurred to me yet, a real embarrassing
  confession given my day job in the realm of code. At any rate, it is here, and we
  are going to be versioning them semantically starting now.
