excerpt: The best place to hide seemed to be, ironically, right behind the ballot
  box. The numerologist and the baker had been underway on a wholly distinct mission,
  having already secured the deflated knifeboats inside a conveniently placed culvert.
  They now seemed to be caught in the crossfire of two opposing factions, each intent
  on some inscrutable and erratically violent purpose that seemed to be nothing but
  foiling the other side’s efforts. The roving skirmishes had drawn away participants
  and created a fairly event-free circle of balance where the pair could hunker down
  and plan their next move. It was going to be a long night.
