excerpt: 'Magic is in the air, so we are starting most appropriately with Boom Pam
  and their take on Steve Miller’s “Abracadabra,” herein entitled “Alakazam.” It only
  got more magical from there with new music from Nick Cave, Fake Fruit, and **Los
  Bitchos**, all of whom are presently on desktop rotation. Next week: a special Fund
  Drive show.'
