excerpt: The catamarine knifed silently upstream, its passage discernible only as
  a faint twin wake on the surface of the river. Up ahead, the sonar array was already
  picking up the turbulence from the Mbocaruzú falls, the staccato warning pings slicing
  neatly between the Mozambique big-band swing being piped into the earpieces. In
  their individual pods, the cartographer and the miner reviewed their maps, surveys,
  and orders. Up ahead, behind the rushing down-flow of the water and completely out
  of sight, a set of steel doors silently opened and awaited the pair’s arrival.
