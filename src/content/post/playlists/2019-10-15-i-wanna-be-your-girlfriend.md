excerpt: Out of all the ways there were to get into Zugdidi — they could have taken
  the ekranoplan, for example — the agency had chosen the bus. This exasperated the
  developer to no end. Their gear sat somewhere in the guts of the green behemoth,
  guarded by six different hardware and software protocols, but it still felt queasy
  to be so far removed from it. The meteorologist peered across the botanical garden
  to the Dadiani palaces. Somewhere in there, a nondescript yogurt stand would have
  a small radio playing Konnakkol techno. They were to purchase two cones and overpay.
  Instructions would follow.
