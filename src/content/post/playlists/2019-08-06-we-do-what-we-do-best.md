excerpt: The mason laid a bare hand on the stone block. It was nearly three hours
  since the sun had set, yet the western-facing brick, part of the multitudinous grid
  that made up Port Blair’s Cellular Jail, still retained a significant amount of
  heat. The cryptographer glanced back at the yelp of surprise, but continued scraping
  a sample into a container with a microchip at its bottom using a dental tool, humming
  along with Caribbean tango audible in the distance. They were supposed to meet the
  man with the elephant down at the beach in only forty-seven minutes. It was still
  unclear why the plan called for such a journey as part of their extraction to Viper
  Island.
