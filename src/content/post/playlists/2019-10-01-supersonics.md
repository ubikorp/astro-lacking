excerpt: The Sasha river was running dry, and the aerialist maneuvered his craft to
  take advantage of the fact. As they moved swiftly along the crumbling banks, exoskeletal
  legs easily scrabbling over the terrain in an unearthly three-limbed gait, they
  encountered sun-baked sections where a trickle fed a series of pools on the cracking
  river bottom, animals congregated around them in a temporary truce. They hadn’t
  seen a human since Saturday, a fact that concerned the actuary more than the dry
  river, and the attempted distraction of some Guatemalan gamelan techno was not working.
  In its steel box, the package of Peanut Butter Crunch patiently rustled and awaited
  its delivery.
