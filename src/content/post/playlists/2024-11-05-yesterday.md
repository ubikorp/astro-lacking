excerpt: It’s election night in the US, but the whole point of today’s show is to
  pretend it isn’t. To that end, we are kicking off with my new favorites **AK/DK**
  — they sound ready to take the system apart using only the crudest electromechanical
  components. Big shout out to the crew near Rocket Park who enjoyed the show to the
  point of calling in. Long live the Gizzle!
