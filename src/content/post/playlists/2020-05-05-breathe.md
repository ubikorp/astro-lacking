excerpt: The strategist made to pick up a card, then withdrew their hand. A cool breeze,
  laden with yesterday’s afternoon dust, stirred through the empty square near the
  Musée Ahmed Zabana, knocking discarded paper cups against the stone table’s legs.  The
  tandem scooter, not something you usually see in these parts of Northern Africa,
  come to think of it the world, leaned against the bench the investigator slouched
  on. “Make your move” their eyes implored in exasperation, as the pair waited for
  the gift shop to open.
