excerpt: Every six years or so, Valentine’s Day lands on a Tuesday, and it’s a grand
  excuse to update and refine the **Fight Night** playlist, featuring two hours of
  music about verbal, physical, and emotional aggression. Why go the opposite way?
  I’m sure those with dates have better things to do than listen to the radio, and
  those without might appreciate the theme. Tonight’s Final Hour is a replay of tracks
  from another Final Hour from about a year ago, with all-new live commentary from
  yours truly.
