excerpt: Firing things up near the top of tonight’s Mixtape are **The Hives** and
  the precision attack of “Rigor Mortis Radio,” from their recent return to affairs
  of sound. Also, what do you know… another fine Fugazi cover to open tonight’s mixtape,
  this one the chromatic riffing of “Merchandise” as interpreted by Sounds Of Swami.
  Elsewhere tonight, a shout-out to Chuck Dinkins for introducing me to Tupelo Chain
  Sex.
