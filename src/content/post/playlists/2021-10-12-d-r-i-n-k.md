excerpt: It's a celebration of Pat Fish, also known as The Jazz Butcher, who passed
  away unexpectedly last week, on October 5. We kick things off with another one of
  my favorites, the Asylum Street Spankers, taking on his "D.R.I.N.K." to glorious
  heights, followed by a couple of sets drawing from his 20th century material.
