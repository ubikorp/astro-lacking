excerpt: A listener suggested I slip in Wham!’s “Last Christmas” but as someone filled
  with old-fashioned Lacking Integrity, I politely declined. That said, your host
  survived the season unscathed. In this episode, we dedicate the Middle Hour to some
  fine covers. Shout out to Robin in Atlanta for hanging out in the late-night post-holiday
  gulch.
