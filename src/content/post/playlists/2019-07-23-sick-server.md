excerpt: The parade stretched through the downtown area, its colorful participants
  a completely normal distribution of small-town denizens. The statistician knew otherwise.
  They stood waving from the platform of the float, their flysuits carefully integrated
  with the diorama to give the appearance of animated mechanical humans. All they
  needed to do was get within twenty feet of The Mayor, and the technology built into
  the platform would do the rest. The imagineer adjusted the EQ on the float’s sound
  system, giving the Estonian techno which poured from the speakers more high-end
  sparkle. The crowd reacted favorably, some of them breaking out into dance.
