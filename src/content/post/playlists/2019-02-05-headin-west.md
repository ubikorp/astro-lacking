excerpt: The vessel floated silently across the Mississippi, as silently as a hovercraft
  possibly could, which was not very silently at all. The two occupants of the walnut-paneled
  bridge listened intently to the sounds of the radio above the drone of the fans,
  one of them spinning the wheel with wild abandon, the other plotting an imaginary
  course over river and land using a nubby pencil and printed map. The sextant lay
  unused, for it was, after all, night.
