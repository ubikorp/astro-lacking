excerpt: If you want suave, it’s hard to get more suave than “Blue Velvet,” and horror-surf
  combo **Messer Chups** delivers a version that’s not only suave but also quite kinetic.
  From the accelerated temp to the lyrical guitar line to the luscious spring reverb,
  it’s a welcome spin on the old croony standard. Tonight’s show was accompanied by
  tremedous wind and lightning, with occasional rain.
