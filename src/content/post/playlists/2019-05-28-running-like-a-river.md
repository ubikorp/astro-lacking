excerpt: 'There wasn’t enough room on the narrow boat for the botanist to take out
  a handkerchief and wipe their brow. The square head vessel, slicing through the
  water on its way to the Phong Dien Floating Market, looked to be laden with mangos,
  but that was a ruse. The pyramids that piled the boat only a had a skin a single
  mango deep. Underneath were piles of something with about the same density as mangos,
  but much much more valuable. The captain twisted the knob on the cabin radio on
  hearing some narcopolka, the device’s limited capacity making the sound increase
  not in volume, only in distortion. The sun sparkled off the water, a thousand heat
  lasers evading the shade thrown by the wide straw hats they wore. '
