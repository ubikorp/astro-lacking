excerpt: Tonight’s show started off with *Picture Book*, a one-hour mixtape of songs
  dedicated to the captured image, whether it be a personal snapshot or an exotic
  postcard. The rest of the night was the usual Mixtape territory, closing out with
  my latest inexplicable favorite, **International Sangman**.
