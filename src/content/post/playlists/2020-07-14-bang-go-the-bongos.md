excerpt: The pediatrician scrambled on hands and knees after the rubber ball. It deflected
  off the base of the Monument to Fuel Tanker, his imperturbable brass cheer completely
  unaffected by the collision. The interlocutor looked around surreptitiously. Their
  aim was to provide some normalcy to the fact that two people were hanging out near
  one of the lowest-ranked attractions in Grodno while the sophisticated electronics
  built into their footwear communicated with the satellite and sorted out the problem
  with the statue. But maybe this game of jacks had not been the best idea for cover.
