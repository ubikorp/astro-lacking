excerpt: 'I was not properly prepared to discuss **Cat Power**’s tribute to Bob Dylan’s
  1966 Royal Albert Hall concert, and specifically where it was recorded, but now
  I can reveal the facts: the Cat Power recording was made at RAH. However, Dylan’s
  original recording was NOT made at RAH, despite the famous bootleg’s common name,
  instead having taken place in Manchester, a good ways away.'
