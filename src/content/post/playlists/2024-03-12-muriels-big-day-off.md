excerpt: A flamboyant tip of the hat to Charley, who shared **Being Dead** with me
  only recently. I am smitten and kicking myself for missing their debut album’s release
  last summer, but I am fiercely making up for lost time. This evening’s Velvet Potty
  Mouth award goes to STRFKR, whose distinctive FUCK sat like a rock in a river of
  glitter and was carefully edited out for the Grand Valley’s sensitive ears.
