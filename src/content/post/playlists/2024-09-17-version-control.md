excerpt: It’s time for the return of **Version Control**, the occasional gathering
  of music as interpreted by someone other than the artists that wrote the song or
  made it famous. You know, covers. After the notorious Cover Drought of 2023, we
  have a full episode of covers ranging from the obscure to the revolutionary.
