excerpt: They had wandered through the town, having left the aquabus in one of the
  drainage ponds at the I-70 interchange. It had been a dusty drive, and the vehicle
  certainly could use the soaking. As they wandered through the town’s enormous collection
  of objects, they felt lilliputian. The dentist rattled the bag of tiles suggestively
  as they walked past the sign for the World’s Largest Rocking Chair. The typesetter
  did not hesitate to point out that at 678 inches, it was the tallest chair of any
  kind in the United States. It was a habit that was both tiresome and instructive.
  And it never got in the way of a quick game of mahjong.
