excerpt: "**Mimi Parker**, vocalist and drummer and half of the Minnesota band **Low**,
  passed away a couple of weeks ago while I was traveling. It’s a shocking loss and
  an abrupt end to a musical career that was still unfolding; the band’s last two
  albums, coming at the tail end of a discography that spans decades, showed a blossoming
  new direction for an act that was famed for their quiet and glacial approach. We
  open the show with Low’s rendition of a Bee Gees classic in tribute."
