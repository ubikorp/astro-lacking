excerpt: "“You missed the white crocodile,” the chipa vendor told them. The mycologist
  and the munitions expert gave the expected sounds of disappointment, the same as
  any tourist drawn to Paraguay’s Ojo de Mar would. One of them spread a blanket by
  the lake side while the other one got busy with entering the passcodes and unlatching
  the efficient-looking metal case they had extracted from the moped. Opening it once
  the blanket was ready, they began taking out the 3D-printed pieces from the foam
  molding with quick, efficient movements as the **Easy Star All-Stars** blared out
  a David Bowie song from the vendor’s portable radio."
