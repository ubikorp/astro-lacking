excerpt: I always admired **The Hold Steady**’s narrative approach to songwriting,
  but I didn’t imagine it could be applied to this particular Western Colorado town,
  and tonight’s opening track clearly shows my lack of imagination. Elsewhere tonight,
  I’m happy to bring you new music from The No Ones, featuring the unmistakable holler
  of one Scott McCaughey of the Young Fresh Fellows, R.E.M., The Baseball Project,
  and so much more.
