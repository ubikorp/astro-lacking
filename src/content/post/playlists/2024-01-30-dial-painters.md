excerpt: There’s a whole new album from **Wreckless Eric**, a whole album, but tonight’s
  selection resonates for the simple fact that this is the third reference to the
  radium girls I’ve heard this week, all from very different sources. As we say around
  these parts, it’s a real plate ‘o shrimp. Also worth noting tonight is n-th track
  from the Bug Club’s _Rare Birds_ album, which has so many good songs on it you’ll
  be hearing from them for months to come, and that’s even with not playing the ones
  with bad words.
