excerpt: It’s a formula as old as time — take four Japanese ladies, dress them up
  in color-coordinated dresses and makeup, and have them play aggressive earworms
  featuring kawaii harmonies and the lethal precision of a veteran death metal band.
  And yet somehow **Otoboke Beaver** rise above the rest of the entrants in this crowded
  field. Who am I kidding, they are one of a kind, and if you’re not listening to
  their latest album on repeat, you are missing out on a lot of endorphins.
