excerpt: I just recently noticed the Morbysphere, the term I had to come up with just
  now for all the interesting music swirling about **Kevin Morby**, his solo work
  and that with Woods and Babies, and now the work of his frequent musical collaborator
  Justin Sullivan as Night Shop, which vibrates in roughly the same product-of-two-primes
  harmonic frequency. Also tonight, I will be breaking my personal record for longest
  track played on the air with the full length of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard’s
  “The Dripping Tap”.
