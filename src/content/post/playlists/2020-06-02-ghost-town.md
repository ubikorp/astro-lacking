excerpt: The composer stood over the gunwale, pressed the small button, and blew into
  the instrument, discharging the contents into the dark green waters below.  If they
  had known it was going to be this type of floating market, they would have picked
  a different watercraft. This explained the unprecedented difficulties when trying
  to secure their transportation with the Colombo office. The ichthyologist indicated
  one of the floating structures, and began maneuvering their craft towards it. The
  composer took a breath and the signal, a brief segment of “Message To You Rudy”,
  went out from the melodica.
