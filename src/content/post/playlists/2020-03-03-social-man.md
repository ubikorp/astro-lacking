excerpt: It was a peaceful suburban street, and they had taken great care to select
  a vehicle that would not stand out when parked along its sidewalks, a gold Taurus
  wagon. The very familiar nature of the setting — the shading trees, the mottled
  but well-kept asphalt, the toys scattered on lawns — made it feel like one of the
  most exotic places they’d been to in a while. The cartographer checked the coordinates
  on the fancy device strapped to their wrist, but any web search could have found
  them Brewster, New York. The ethnomusicologist leaned against the mailbox, labeled
  “Marie”, and scanned the canopy of the tremendous spreading oak planted square in
  the middle of the lawn, eyes peeled for that squirrel.
