excerpt: After a dormancy of a few years, **The Dodos** have re-emerged and proven
  to be anything but extinct. This duo makes a sound that is easy to recognize but
  hard to describe, a sort of acoustic progressive metal filled with droning rhythms
  and cascading guitars that you can clearly hear on the appropriately-titled “Unicorn”.
