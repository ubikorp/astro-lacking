excerpt: The end of the year slide has commenced, and things feel somewhat lackadaisical,
  but there’s still a huge backlog of new music to get through. Among the highlights
  is a new album from **Amyl and the Sniffers**, which contains lots of great stuff
  the FCC would frown on, but I was able to find one track that required minimal editing
  for compatibility.
