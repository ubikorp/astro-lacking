excerpt: Maybe it’s the lackadaisical groove she can effortlessly establish, or her
  warm confident voice, but listening to **Madison Cunningham** is like sinking into
  the sofa for a new episode of your favorite show, a general feeling of ease, comfort,
  and complete enjoyment. Also, maybe you thought you heard a dirty word during “Tounge-Clucking
  Grammarian”, but you didn’t — let’s face, there’s a lot of rhymes for “clucking”
  that could register a false positive.
