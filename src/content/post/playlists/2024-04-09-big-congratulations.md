excerpt: Tonight, we start with a special presentation of **My Favorite Lies**, a
  one-hour collection of songs about untruths, deception, fakery, and more. Moving
  on, we filled the rest of the evening with the usual variety of genres, mostly from
  the last few months. Of particular note are new releases from **Holiday Ghosts**,
  Adrienne Lenker, and Alejandro Escovedo.
