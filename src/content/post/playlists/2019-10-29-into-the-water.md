excerpt: The screen door banged against the frame of the small building that was once
  Cisco, Utah’s non-bustling post office. It’s like a ghost town abandoned by the
  ghosts, mused the cinematographer. Whatever once haunted this place left out of
  boredom. Meanwhile, the blacksmith methodically tapped the foundation along the
  perimeter of the building. They had brought the infractometer over from the side-by-side
  they had arrived in, but sometimes the old ways worked best. The rhythm etched out
  a Namibian bossanova that had been popular in the ‘70s. The entrance to the silo
  complex had to be near.
