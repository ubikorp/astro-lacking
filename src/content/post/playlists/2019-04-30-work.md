excerpt: The mechanical harvestman towered over the fig grove, its spindly arms tucked
  underneath as it towered over the fruit trees. The cryptobotanist aimed the infrared
  reader at the edge of the cultivated land, where the real Bhutan took over, hoping
  for even a quick glimpse. The landscape gave nothing in return. The operator’s headphones
  leaked the sound of some Turkish reggae, bounced from a satellite to overcome the
  foreboding mountains that ringed the valley. They both had patience to spare. The
  beast they were seeking had only one food source, located right here, and everyone’s
  gotta eat.
