excerpt: "“Did you say you wanted FIVE?” asked the turkey-leg vendor, his incredulity
  betraying the slightest bit of Norwegian accent. The crowds at the Trondenes Middle
  Ages Visitor Park thronged past as the young man counted the hands available to
  the pair before him, performed a simple matching algorithm to the five turkey-legs
  being requested, and came up with a non-computing value. “We’re hungry,” offered
  the machinist helpfully. The gymnast kept an eye out for Sverre the allodialist.
  They needed to have a few words with him about the land titles, preferably in the
  privacy of the sleek three-man catamaran that had discretely brought them here.
  The half-darkening of the sky that passed for night at these latitudes meant the
  usual tactics were out and they would have to convince him to come willingly."
