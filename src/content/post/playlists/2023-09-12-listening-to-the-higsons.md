excerpt: I meant to write the notes for this show sooner than a month after the fact,
  but travel plans got in the way and here I am struggling for an intro. I can tell
  you that hearing **Sparklehorse** take on Robyn Hitchcock and the Egyptians’ “Listening
  to the Higsons” for the first time, mere weeks ago, felt like someone became obsessed
  with the same cassette as I did thirty years ago, but actually got around to letting
  the hen out.
