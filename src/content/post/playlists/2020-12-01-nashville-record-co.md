excerpt: 'The Shilin Night Market had seemed to grow even more chaotic in the intervening
  years, yet the vendors and customers still retained their preternatural calm, as
  if the events happening all around them were due to forces completely out of their
  control. As the skeptic checked the status lights on the Stinky Tofu Containment
  Device for the seventh time that mission, the inspector pinged the jetpacks they
  had secured under a table of bejeweled phone cases to make sure they were primed
  for a quick getaway. Their progress came to a sudden halt as they considered the
  sign before them: “Small Sausage In Large Sausage - $120”'
