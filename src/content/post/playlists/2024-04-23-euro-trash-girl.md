excerpt: When you set out to record a song that’s been famous, or popular, or claimed
  in some other way by some other artist, you are taking a shortcut with great risks
  and great rewards. Rarely can you pull it off the way **Chicks On Speed** do with
  their rendition of Cracker’s “Euro Trash Girl,” with a radical approach to deconstructing
  and reassembling the indie country hit. You’ll just have to hear for yourself.
