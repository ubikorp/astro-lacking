excerpt: The world that deliberately-lowercased **beabadoobee** presents in her new
  album Beatopia is pastel neon colors, soothing howls, bright shadows, and all manner
  of psychedelic oxymorons. Tonight’s show features its introduction of sorts, and
  closes with the unexpected krautrock drone of my current favorite discovery, Japan’s
  deliberately-uppercased MASS OF THE FERMENTING DREGS, whose all-over-the-placeness
  manages to live up to its intriguing name.
