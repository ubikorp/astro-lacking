excerpt: Every so often, I’ll gather up some of my favorite tracks from the last sixty
  minutes of my three-hour radio show and create an entire episode of **The Final
  Hour**, this one being the third such installment. This is the music that is played
  between 11pm and midnight, and it’s generally darker, more instrumental, sometimes
  even experimental, and this is an opportunity for the chronologically challenged
  to experience some of that closer to their regular waking hours.
