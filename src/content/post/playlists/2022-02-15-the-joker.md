excerpt: Sometimes it takes a while for an album to be recognized as a classic, sometimes
  the shock of recognition is instant and universal. This is the case for **Spoon**
  and their latest release, *Lucifer on the Sofa,* which showcases much of what has
  made the band a constant source of solid material, but in a concentrated way that
  will make you start all over as soon as you hit the end.
