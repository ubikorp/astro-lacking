excerpt: In the last few years, John Lydon, once known to the world as Johnny Rotten,
  has been in the news for a variety of reasons, none of them related to his music,
  most of them leading to unfortunate public judgements. His band’s new album makes
  their name **Public Image Ltd** a handy reminder, as it serves up a take on society
  more in tune with their past work than the expected yelling-at-clouds. Elsewhere!
  To the listeners voicing strong opinions about the adorably shrill kids’ story that
  ran at the top of The Final Hour — your comments were passed on to Management and
  that short chunk of audio root canal is gone. Well done!
