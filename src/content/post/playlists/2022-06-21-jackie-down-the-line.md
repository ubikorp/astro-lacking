excerpt: Coming straight outta Dublin, **Fontaines DC** have an insistent and incisive
  sound that carves anthems out of marble using only guitar strings and a chiseling
  voice. No particular theme seems to emerge tonight, although we will be closing
  with Angel Olsen’s “Go Home.” Go home, it’s midnight.
