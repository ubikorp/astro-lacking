excerpt: The Musée National stood like a squat block, facing the highway at an angle
  and mirrored to the left by the library. The hu hu sat inside, waiting in the wing
  housing the musical instrument collection. The surgeon nervously handled the endoscope
  case, dusty from the helicopter ride that had brought them to N’Djamena. The calligrapher
  was clearly nervous but their services would only be required for brief minutes
  while they inspected the inscription on the inside of the ancient calabash.
