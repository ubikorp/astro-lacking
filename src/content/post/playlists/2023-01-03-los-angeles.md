excerpt: Tonight’s opening theme is clearly tribute to the Imaginary City — the opening
  cover is from the town’s **The Streetwalkin’ Cheetahs**, who are named after an
  Iggy and the Stooges lyric and have been pumping out a corresponding racket for
  about 30 years now. The song itself, originally by X, is about a friend of the band
  that left for England to hook up with the Damned’s Captain Sensible. The lore is
  unclear on whether the Captain was expecting that or not.
