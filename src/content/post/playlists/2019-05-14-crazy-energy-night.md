excerpt: The earth rumbled into an appropriate angle of repose as the bucket wheel
  ground to a halt. On the ground, the sapper raised an arm to signal to the operator,
  sitting high above in an air-conditioned cab as disproportionately tiny as a brontosaurus
  brain. The sounds of Taiwanese ragtime could be heard on the earpiece now that the
  excavator had stopped digging into the hard Upper Peninsula soil. This machine was
  capable of extracting tons of copper ore in a single hour, but now it was digging
  for something far more valuable.
