excerpt: The haberdasher heard a light thump and roll, then felt something tap against
  a shoe. It was a peach pit. Looking up from the stack of brochures, they saw the
  orthodontist grinning and wiping their mouth with a sleeve, glancing at the gap
  on the blanket where the fruit was drying in the sun, clearly suggesting that perhaps
  another one was in order. The tandem moped leaned against the back of the Gate of
  Hercules, shielded by its bulk from the bright Croatian summer sun. The peaches
  had hours to go, and they had forgotten to bring a game., having only whatever reading
  material they had managed to scrape up in the Hotel Pula lobby.
