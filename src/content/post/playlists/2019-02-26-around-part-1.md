excerpt: The specialist carefully manipulated the waldoes linked to the robotic arms
  in the front of the submersible. The pilot peered out of the top dome, the glare
  of the spotlights illuminating the complex structure of the oil rig but the visibility
  of this part of the Gulf of Mexico not allowing much to be seen past the first couple
  tangles of girders. A single wire tethered the craft to the surface, its sole purpose
  safely delivering the radio signal carrying its obscure music and coded instructions
  past fathoms of seawater. The robot arms clasped the watertight bale of Oaxacan
  tamales tightly. The mission was only half over.
