excerpt: The driver felt the leads tremble under their hands. The navigator clung
  resolutely to the sled, keeping an eye on the white horizon of the Wexford hills
  as they put some miles between themselves and the Monongahela. The only sound besides
  the rushing skids on the snow and the panting of the dogs was a faint crackle of
  song leaking from the driver’s earpiece. The heist had been a success; behind them,
  a net filled with silver Mylar balloons trailed and bobbed in the generated midnight
  wind.
