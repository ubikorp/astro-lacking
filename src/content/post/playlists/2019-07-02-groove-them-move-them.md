excerpt: The chauffeur peered at the rear-view mirror. The scattered reflection from
  the rain-slicked A7 revealed only headlights, no politely alarming Luxembourg police
  flashers. The Corniche bulleted down the roadway, the flutter of its diplomatic
  flags the only sign that it wasn’t standing dead still. Some miles away, in Ettelbruck,
  the authorities were coming to the conclusion that the altercation at Chez Fred
  had been a distraction. In the back seat, the jeweler closed the briefcase, satisfied
  with its contents.
