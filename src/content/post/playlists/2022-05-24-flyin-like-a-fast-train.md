excerpt: 'I always thought **Kurt Vile** was a play on the name of the German composer
  that gave us “Mack The Knife,” but that seems to be his given name (bonus: middle
  name is Samuel). Sonically, he’s more in line with Lou Reed than Weill, topping
  his awkward nouveau folk with a voice that may not be the most musical but is actually
  the perfect medium to express this particular malarkey.'
