excerpt: Bo Diddley may have written tonight’s opening cover, and **Spoon** may be
  the one actually performing it, but the spirit of Billy Childish, whose version
  earworms its way through my head every year or so, is quite strong on the shambling,
  end-of-the-rehearsal vibe heard here. To the listeners voicing strong opinions about
  the adorably shrill kids’ story that runs at the top of The Final Hour — your notes
  have been passed on to Management.
