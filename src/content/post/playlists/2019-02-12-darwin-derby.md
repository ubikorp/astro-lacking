excerpt: The thin Nebraska ice crackled ominously as one of the occupants of the well-appointed
  tent leaned back on their recliner. They peered at their line, descending into the
  near-freezing water and vibrating sympathetically to the sounds of the radio. The
  other ice-fisher threw a log on the fire, pausing in recognition at the song before
  smiling and turning it up.
