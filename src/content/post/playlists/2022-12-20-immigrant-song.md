excerpt: I used to get a couple of dozen packages containing CDs each day, but these
  days receiving even one is something that happens once in a blue moon, a rare treat.
  It’s even more special when it contains a couple of releases from **Sex Clark Five**,
  one of my personal favorites. They sound like blurting out that thing you told yourself
  you weren’t going to say but felt good to say.
