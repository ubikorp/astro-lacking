excerpt: The archivist’s breath misted in the freezing vault as gloved hands lifted
  the metal canister off the shelf. Getting to Greenland had not been trivial, driving
  the snowcats to Nuuk undetected had been a challenge, and breaking into the Katuaq
  Cultural Centre’s secret collection room, dug out of the permafrost, could be described
  as difficult. Now, locating the footage was close to impossible, given the hundreds
  of linear meters of shelving that were visible. The producer unspooled the first
  few feet off the reel, peering up through the film to the overhead light. The muffled
  sound of Persian hip-hop could be heard from the theater above. Maybe it was not
  so impossible.
