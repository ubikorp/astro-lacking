excerpt: This is SOME LIKE IT HOT, a Mixtape of music about all things that are Not
  Cold, an hour of songs about heat and warm places, and bands that celebrate this
  elusive phenomenon. Although sometimes it resorts to extremes, it is hoped that
  this sonic concoction delivers some measure of imaginary heat to the listener.
