excerpt: 'The accordionist’s boot was tangled in a mangrove root. The deepening dusk
  of Meads Bay Pond brought with it a soft breeze and an ugly threat of bug swarms.
  Their chances of getting to the beach and capturing enough glowing sugar crabs were
  dwindling. The roots, more like underwater dreadlocks, heaved as the booted foot
  attempted to twist out, the accordion case held high as counterbalance. The technician
  glared at the spectacle briefly before shining a light on the clipboard. In the
  distance, a barbershop quartet with a Tuvan throat-singing baritone made it incongruous
  presence known. The keys to the long-range waterbikes had a floaty thing on them,
  but they were permanently attached to the metal clipboard, which would sink like
  a stone. The Governor’s Office back in The Valley would certainly hear about this.
