excerpt: I’m not going to deny the synesthetic appeal of songs with words about pictures,
  but there is something additionally poignant about the mood created that seems to
  stand out. The images called forth serve a variety of purposes, from the reminiscent
  to the hedonistic, but just like your family album, the whole thing works out because
  it has to.
