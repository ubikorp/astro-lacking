excerpt: 'Paleface didn’t say it first, but he probably said it best: it’s a **World
  Full of Cops**. Musicians and the authorities have been at each other’s throats
  for a while now, and there is no shortage of songs showing cops in a bad light,
  so what I like about “World Full of Cops” is its simple observational mantra: they
  are everywhere, we put them there, and they are us. Enjoy a full evening of police-themed
  music — it’s the law!'
