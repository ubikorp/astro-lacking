excerpt: "“Batu means ‘rock’ in Malay” said the photographer, for the third time in
  a week. The sous-chef ignored the comment, also for the third time, and tried squinting
  in the darkness at the cribbage board. They had been wise enough to purchase a glow-in-the-dark
  deck after all these midnight assignments, but had yet to extend their ingenuity
  to the board. Tapping a foot in irritation, they knocked over the thermos full of
  hot cocoa set on the steps, and it would have rolled down several long flights of
  guano-covered stairs had it not been stopped by the tandem bike’s wheel leaning
  against the statue’s pedestal. Above them, Lord Murugan stared stonily into the
  dark."
