excerpt: The baker took one last look at the cake, sitting on its gold-rimmed stand
  on the veranda, the carefully cultivated gardens surrounding the Palacio Rioja visible
  in the background. If it weren’t for the two backpack stealthcopters leaning against
  the railing, it would be Instagrammable, hashtag noneofyourbusiness. The architect
  finished the final touches, and gave a silent nod. In a smooth motion, the two of
  them had their packs on and had plummeted over the edge, carefully angling away
  to not disturb the icing.
