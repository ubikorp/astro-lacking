excerpt: The new album from **Jen Cloher** is magnificent, and when her Twitter account
  favorited the playlist entry for the lead track tonight, I near swooned. I recommend
  you listen to *I Am The River, The River Is Me* from start to finish, and enjoy
  something you’ll be doing for years to come for the first time. In other news, our
  recently adopted cat Princess Otoboke Beaver (aka Pris) gave birth to four healthy
  kittens on St. Patrick’s day — Ziggy, Stardust, Spider, and Mars.
