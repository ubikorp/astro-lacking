excerpt: The courier unrolled the blueprints onto the brightly-lit drafting table.
  The basement of the Gomel Regional Museum of Military Glory was not only roomy enough
  to house several specimens of large weaponry, but also extremely well illuminated.
  The historian had mused, repeatedly, on how some of the bigger pieces must have
  been disassembled in the field then reassembled in here for storage, hence the need
  for the lights. Upstairs, the gala which had served as their cover for entry continued
  into the night, the band now striking up some sort of Caspian samba. Quite an elaborate
  operation, but they needed to machine a new aileron for the ekranoplan, and this
  was the only place they would find the designs.
