excerpt: The engineer looked through the diminishing dawn murk and spotted the specialist’s
  orange scarf. The sound of the balloon-tired swamp bikes spread through the Estonian
  bog like hot molasses, obscuring their location but not their presence. Unnoticed
  in the bike’s twin V mud-wakes, a nearly-vertical black snorkel tube trailed the
  pair.
