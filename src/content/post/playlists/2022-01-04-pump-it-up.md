excerpt: You might think **Juanes** is some sort of reference to a collective of people
  named Juan, but it is actually a single Juan, more accurately a Colombian named
  Juan Esteban Aristizábal Vásquez. Here he is singing along to Elvis Costello and
  the Attractions as part of the fascinating *Spanish Model* project.
