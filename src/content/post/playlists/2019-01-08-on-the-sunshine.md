excerpt: It's a slack time for new releases, but The Lacking Organization still has
  a tremendous backlog of excellent music from 2018 to work through. Gratitude to
  tonight's participants, ranging from Charley attending CES in Las Vegas to Sean
  fiddling with the dial and wondering if he got the right station.
