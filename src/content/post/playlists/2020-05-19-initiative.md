excerpt: The topologist carefully unfolded the graph depicting prime number frequencies.
  Across the scrub, the baker was returning from the Unimog, having concluded the
  search, and from the looks of their empty hands, unsuccessfully. They must have
  left it in the cab back in Calabar. Wonderful. Together, they considered the placement
  of the carved stone monoliths before them, their geometric arrangement random to
  the average visitor, but a clear reflection of order to the ancient people of Alok
  Ikom, and apparently, also related to the graph before them, with cataclysmic mathematical
  consequences.
