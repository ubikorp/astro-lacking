excerpt: Always a special treat to be back on the air after missing a show. This is
  the third show in a year that I’ve started with a Fugazi cover, in this case **Failure**
  taking on “Waiting Room” with their trademark grinding, implacable approach. The
  power of these songs, its distinctive musicality and lyrical content, is undiminished
  in the hands of any band bold enough to take on the material. Tonight also featured
  the confluence of several loyal listeners, including James in California, Underdog
  in Georgia, and Charley who is on South Korea time and got to take benefit from
  the time zone.
