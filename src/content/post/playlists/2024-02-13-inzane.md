excerpt: It’s the evening before Valentine’s Day, which means absolutely nothing here
  at lacking org. Instead, we’re opening up with the Sex Clark Five taking on the
  Byrds, and something from Norwegian up-and-comers **Mall Girl**, who manage to hold
  up a broken mirror to American indie rock without cutting themselves to shreds.
  Also, their bassist name-checks Laddio Bollocko. Also tonight, more splendiferous
  instrumental musings from the incomparable Matt Berry to kick off the Final Hour.
