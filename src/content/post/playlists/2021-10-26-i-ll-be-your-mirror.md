excerpt: 'The first time you hear Courtney Barnett taking on the Velvet Underground''s
  "I''ll Be Your Mirror," what you get is an electrifying shock of recognition: you
  know that distinctive voice, you know that timeless melody, but what you''re hearing
  is completely new. I must add that there''s a VU tribute album every few years,
  and even the worst of them can be decent, supported by the strength of the songs,
  but this one (also titled I''ll Be Your Mirror) is exceptionally good.'
