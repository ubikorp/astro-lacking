excerpt: It was a day of jet-setting, starting in the dark hours of morning, and it
  wasn’t going to be over until the studio light went off. To keep up the energy levels,
  we presented a double-header of a special, first an hour of **The Famous Polka**,
  featuring songs titled after real (mostly) people, and following that two hours
  of **Balkan Fever**, with music that was far from exclusively Balkan but all fed
  into that manic two-step non-stop feeling.
