excerpt: I am proud to bring you **KNOWER**, despite the fact that I constantly stumble
  over how to announce the name of the band, trying to tease out the magical diphtong
  that distinguishes it from “nowhere” to the listener. I love them so much I will
  even respect their penchant to spell their name in all-caps. Led by Louis Cole and
  Genevieve Artadi and often spiced with cameos, their take on modern jazz funk /
  funk jazz is always on tap to fix a day going wrong.
