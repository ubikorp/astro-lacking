excerpt: The original “Crimson and Clover” was Tommy James and the Shondells' biggest
  hit, but it was also one of the first songs to be recorded on 16 track equipment,
  and is a textbook example on the use (or overuse) of rhythmic tremolo. Pom Pom Squad
  does a good job of channeling the song's sweet yet feral vibe.
