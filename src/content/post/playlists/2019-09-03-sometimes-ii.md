excerpt: The economist wondered where they’d be if the herpetologist had been available.
  Probably not prone under a cover of leaves, covered in protective armor, tapping
  two small bamboo sticks as a ruse to attract a golden lancehead. The rhythm was
  from the single Nordic folk d’n’b that had played on repeat 142 times on their trip
  out of the Port of Santos. It had been difficult to find a captain willing to land
  them on Ilha de Quemaida, so it was not wise to criticize their choice of music
  for the journey. The epidemiologist was nearby, peering into the carefully held
  vial and running the numbers on when it would be filled at the current rate of collection,
  and how quickly they could get off the island once that moment arrived.
