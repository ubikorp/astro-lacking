excerpt: This is HOUSE MUSIC, a special one-hour mixtape from yours truly featuring
  songs about homes, residences, possibly apartments, and other locations of abode.
  I ran out of time and didn’t get to play “Stranger In The House” with Elvis Costello
  and George Jones, but surely it will fit into a future show.
