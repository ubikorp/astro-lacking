excerpt: 'It’s a bitterly cold night, though the thermometer is not the lowest it’s
  been this winter. Warming things up is **King Tuff**, whose twisted bedroom psychedelia
  is heating up my house in the manner of an unexpected early spring. It’s a strong
  start for an extended set of sounds simultaneously catchy and powerful. Technical
  note: The Mixtape sounds best when recorded on TDK SA90 cassettes. Do not attempt
  to do this on Maxell XLIIs.'
