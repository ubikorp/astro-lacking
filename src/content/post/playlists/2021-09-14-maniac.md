excerpt: Some bands are obscure, others are sporadic, but The Mabuses are downright
  enigmatic. Their music is hard to describe, and while the word "psychedelic" has
  become a commonplace and devalued label to put on something these days, in this
  case it would apply as a feeling of existing in a disjointed but entirely fascinating
  musical reality rather than a genre.
