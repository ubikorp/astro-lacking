excerpt: It's a steamy Florida night, and it marks the debut of Julius C. Lacking
  on the airwaves of WFIT, a university radio station in Melbourne, Florida. The random
  nature of the playlist is born of a catastrophic home furnishing disaster that hopelessly
  jumbled the contents of the vaunted Lacking Selection, the music library which Julius
  has been aggregating for the last twenty years. The process of its re-cataloging
  and collation, which promises to last decades, will henceforth be known as The Lacking
  Organization. Let it begin.
