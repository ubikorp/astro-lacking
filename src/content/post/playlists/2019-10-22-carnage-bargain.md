excerpt: Would the tour of palaces never end? Having visited several monarchical residences,
  the cobbler had become habitually underwhelmed with the perpetual ostentation. Taking
  a seat at a padded bench to admire the mosaics of Dar al-Makhzen, the topologist
  hummed a Balkan square-dancing melody. The ancient Land Cruiser that had brought
  them here, well-cared for and highly-modified, sat in a modern parking lot that
  clashed with the surrounding Moroccan geometry. They pretended to take some selfies
  while monitoring the 360° camera feed coming from the vehicle.
