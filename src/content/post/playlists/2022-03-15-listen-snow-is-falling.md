excerpt: 'When I was younger, still developing my musical tastes, in an era where
  the Beatles were closer to those days than Nirvana are to these, I hated on Yoko.
  It''s what we all did. The older me, like **Stephin Merritt** and the many other
  luminaries on _Ocean Child: Songs of Yoko Ono_, appreciates the inexpressible beauty
  and uncompromising nature of her art.'
