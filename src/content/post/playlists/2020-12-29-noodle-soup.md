excerpt: The journey to the island had been placid, cutting through the postcard-blue
  waters on the kite hydrofoil like an experienced tailor shearing fine cloth for
  a new suit. Things were a bit more complicated now that they were at the Heraklion
  Archaeological Museum. The horologist consulted the mission notes, which simply
  stated “remove all anachronistic displays.” The historian, fearing seasickness,
  had taken a pill and was now having a comically adverse reaction that rendered them
  useless for these judgements. A security guard eyed them warily, but perhaps they
  could turn the situation to their advantage by playing up the effects as excessive
  inebriation.
