excerpt: A soft Texas breeze ruffled the grass along the banks of Belton Lake. Why
  not Lake Belton? wondered the hydrologist. Behind the trees, the aviator finished
  securing the paragliders. They had arrived with two, but would be leaving with three,
  which added a true twist to the logistics. Across the water, the sounds of Jamaican
  country music could clearly be heard coming from a raucous campsite. They were about
  300 feet away, and had not been part of the plan. But if there were to be witnesses,
  then let them be the inebriated type.
