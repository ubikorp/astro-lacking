excerpt: 'Dating back to a time before the whole phrase was unceremoniously truncated
  to “chillax”, Serge Gainsbourg’s imploration to enhance your mood is given a frantic
  workout by **Stereo Total** and in this case, their toy electronic noisemakers are
  a welcome homage. Elsewhere this show, we have Carl King’s prog-rock-and-glockenspiel
  interpretation of Rebecca Black’s infamous “Friday” … and it’s quite the improvement. '
