excerpt: The mechanic reached deep into the tool bag, knowing the required spanner
  would be at the very bottom. The clanking briefly drowned out the strains from the
  radio, its signal relayed every 500 meters by the commpods they had dropped on the
  way. Carefully fitting the business end of the tool between the rear set of treads
  on the boring machine, they found themselves exclaiming out loud “actually, I think
  it’s pretty interesting.” The surveyor, measuring the long tunnel behind them with
  an x-ray transit, looked back briefly, by now used to such outbursts. The cavern
  should be another two miles down.
