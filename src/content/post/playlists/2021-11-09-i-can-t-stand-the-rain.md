excerpt: The rich wood floorboards were squeaking under the strain of the game. They
  had removed their shoes, sketched out the board using a special beeswax that would
  not damage the finish, and were hopping as lightly as they could, for they respected
  the solemnity of their location. Nonetheless, the portraits lining the Hall of Admirals
  in the Museo Maritimo Nacional felt they finally had something to frown about, their
  serious Chilean brows furrowed in naval concern as they observed the farrier and
  the anthropologist enjoying their tournament.
