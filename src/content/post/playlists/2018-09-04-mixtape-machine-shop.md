excerpt: This is MACHINE SHOP, a special one-hour mixtape from yours truly featuring
  songs about all the weird devices we humans have imagined and constructed out of
  musical parts. I’m closing it out with the Smugglers’ “She’s A Machine,” which inspired
  me to put this together when a search for it revealed all sorts of inexplicable
  gadgetry lurking in my library.
