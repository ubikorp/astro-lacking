excerpt: No pan flute, no washes of synthesizer textures, just **Olivia Jean** doing
  her best impression of a land-bound siren and kicking up the octane in the Enya
  original to unsafe levels. It’s a hot summer so far, with lots of great releases
  crowding the older stuff out of the playlist, and it shows no sign of letting up.
  There’s a new album from the Boo Radleys (it’s been a while!), and I am obsessing
  over motorik sounds from Orange Drink and Motor!k. It’s far more than will fit on
  a single cassette, unless you get one of those ultra-long ones that your car deck
  will eventually eat up.
