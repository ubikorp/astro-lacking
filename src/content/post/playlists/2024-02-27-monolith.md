excerpt: A very quiet night, perhaps everyone is hunkering down for the leap day.  Featured
  is **IDLES**, who all look like they could recommend a good IPA, and also would
  be willing to kick my ass for thinking so. Tonight featured more than our usual
  ration of covers, starting with a not-unlikely take on Beck’s “Loser” and following
  up with takes on tracks originally made famous by Muppets and Devo.
