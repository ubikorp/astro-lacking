excerpt: 'The carefully curated collection of artists performing tracks made famous
  by other artists continues, in the third annual **Version Control**. Some of these
  could be so obscure as to ask “is it a cover if I never heard the original” but
  we can leave the answering of that to the armchair philosophers. I’ll go on the
  record saying a good song is a good song no matter who performs it. Also, to the
  listener and fellow cassette afficionado that complained about Maxell and Memorex
  being mentioned in the same breath: my point is that neither one of them is TDK.'
